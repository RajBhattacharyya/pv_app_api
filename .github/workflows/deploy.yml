**Changes:**

1. **Smaller Runner:** Changed `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` to `runs-on: ubuntu-20.04` to use a smaller and more energy-efficient runner.
2. **Caching:** Added a `Cache node modules` step to cache node modules and reduce installation time and energy consumption.
3. **Shorter Jobs:** No major changes were made to shorten jobs, as the original workflow was already relatively short.
4. **Eco-friendly Runners:** The use of a smaller runner, like `ubuntu-20.04`, is a step towards using more eco-friendly runners.

**Additional Recommendations:**

1. **Use a more energy-efficient cloud provider:** Consider using a cloud provider that uses renewable energy sources or has a strong commitment to sustainability.
2. **Optimize your application:** Make sure your application is optimized for performance and energy efficiency.
3. **Use a CI/CD tool with a strong focus on sustainability:** Consider using a CI/CD tool that has a strong focus on sustainability and energy efficiency.
