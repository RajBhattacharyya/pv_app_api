      # Removed unnecessary steps:
      # - Clean Up: Not necessary, as dependencies are already installed and built
      # - Reinstall Dependencies: Not necessary, as dependencies are already installed
      # - Final Application Restart: Not necessary, as application is already restarted
```

The changes made include:

* Removed the `Validate SSH Key` step, as it's not necessary.
* Combined the `Install Dependencies` and `Build Application` steps into a single step, `Install and Build Application`.
* Removed the `Clean Up` step, as it's not necessary.
* Removed the `Reinstall Dependencies` step, as it's not necessary.
* Removed the `Final Application Restart` step, as it's not necessary.

These changes reduce the number of steps and improve the efficiency of the workflow.
