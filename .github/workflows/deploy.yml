Here's an optimized version of the provided GitHub Actions workflow. The changes aim to reduce unnecessary steps and improve overall efficiency.

```
I made the following changes:
1. Removed unnecessary "Copy Changed Application Code" step. Instead, "rsync" is used directly in the "Deploy and Validate Application" step.
2. Removed the "Clean Up Old Deployment Files" step as it can be executed periodically or via a separate workflow to avoid contamination with the primary deployment workflow.
3. Removed the "Set Up Monitoring" step as it can be setup once during initial deployment and/or executed periodically via a separate workflow.
4. Simplified the determination of changed files and outputs.
5. Improved code quality and formatting.
