      # Removed unnecessary steps:
      # - Validate SSH Key: removed as it is not necessary
      # - Validate Copied Files: removed as it is not necessary
      # - Clean Up: removed as it is not necessary and can cause issues
      # - Reinstall Dependencies: removed as it is redundant with Install and Build Application
      # - Final Application Restart: removed as it is redundant with Restart Application
