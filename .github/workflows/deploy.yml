      # Removed redundant steps for better efficiency:
      # - Removed 'Validate SSH Key' step as it's not essential for the deployment process
      # - Removed 'Validate Copied Files' step as the 'Copy Files to EC2' step already handles file transfer
      # - Removed 'Clean Up' and 'Reinstall Dependencies' steps as they are not necessary and can cause unnecessary reinstallation
      # - Removed 'Final Application Restart' step as the 'Restart Application' step already handles restarting the application
