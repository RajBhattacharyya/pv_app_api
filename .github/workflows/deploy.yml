Additional recommendations:

* Consider adding more detailed logging statements throughout the workflow to provide better visibility into the deployment process.
* Implement automated rollbacks in case the deployment fails or the application becomes unhealthy after deployment.
* Set up monitoring tools to track the performance and health of the application after deployment.
* Ensure that sensitive information, such as the EC2 SSH key, is stored securely using GitHub secrets.
