```
The changes made include:

* Removing redundant steps (e.g., separate steps for installing dependencies, building, and restarting the application)
* Combining related tasks into a single step (e.g., checking out code and setting up SSH key)
* Removing unnecessary validation steps (e.g., validating copied files)
* Removing the "Clean Up" step, which is not necessary and can cause issues if the application is still running
* Removing the "Reinstall Dependencies" and "Final Application Restart" steps, which are redundant and unnecessary.
